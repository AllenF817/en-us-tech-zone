## General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) Overview

GDPR is a set of data privacy rules that apply broadly to both companies in the European Union (EU) and the usage of data pertaining to EU residents. The GDPR went into full effect on the 25th of May, 2018 across the EU. The official regulation includes several
chapters which are further broken down into “articles”, or subsections that describe specific provisions, which are referenced frequently by number or title in documents describing how to comply with their requirements.

### GDPR seeks to:

* Unify European data protection regulations
* Protect the data privacy of EU residents
* Manage how organizations approach data privacy

**Note:** Personal data is any information relating to an identifiable person, therefore it is often referred to as personally identifiable
information (PII). It could include information such as names, photographs, IP or email addresses, and medical information.

### The GDPR applies to:

* Organizations operating within the EU
* Organizations operating outside of the EU who offer goods, services or are involved in ‘monitoring the behavior’ of EU residents

**Note:** Privacy considerations for GDPR span the data lifecycle from opt-in collection, to specific or anonymized usage and secured disposal and retirement of data. It covers all personal data relating to your customers, employees, supply chain, partners and anyone else about whom you collect personal information.

### Two key GDPR article will be the focus of this document

* Access control (Article 25) - calls out particular measures which shall ensure that by default
personal data is not made accessible without the individual’s intervention to an indefinite number of natural persons.
* Encryption and data protection (Article 32) - calls out:
  * Pseudonymisation and encryption of personal data
  * Ensure the ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability and resilience of processing systems and services
  * The ability to restore the availability and access to personal data in a timelymanner in the event of a physical or technical incident
  * Protection from accidental and unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure of, or access to personal data transmitted, stored or otherwise processed
