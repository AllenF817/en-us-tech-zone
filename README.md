# Citrix Tech Zone readme

## Welcome

Welcome to the documentation project for [techzone.citrix.com](https://techzone.citrix.come)! Citrix Tech Zone is home for technical, in-depth articles that are inspired and driven by technical communities and enthusiasts. Whether you are an architect, consultant, engineer or technical IT manager, you have come to the right place!

Tech Zone has always been oriented towards technical community, but now you can help us to make it better by suggesting changes or even writing the whole articles to share with fellow Citrix fans.

As many other large companies (including Microsoft or Amazon), we are using de-facto industry standard language called markdown to create Tech Zone content.
